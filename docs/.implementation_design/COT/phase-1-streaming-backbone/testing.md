# Phase 1 — User Testing

## How to Test
- Open the app at `http://localhost:5173`.
- Enter a query (e.g., “latest testing trends”).
- Watch progress messages appear; then the final summary should replace them.

## What to Look For
- Short, plain messages (no jargon).
- Stream stays connected during longer queries.
- A clear error message if something goes wrong mid-stream.

## Pass/Fail
- Pass: You see progress → answer, with minimal wording.
- Fail: No progress messages, or the connection drops unexpectedly.
