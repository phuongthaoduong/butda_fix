# Phase 2 — User Testing

## How to Test
- Open the app and submit a query.
- Observe the progress area: it should update as the agent works.

## What to Look For
- Clear, short messages: “Starting”, “Searching”, “Reading”, “Thinking”, “Writing”.
- No repeated “Loading” spam.
- Progress disappears automatically when the final answer shows.

## Pass/Fail
- Pass: Messages are understandable and feel calm; answer replaces CoT.
- Fail: Messages are technical, repeated, or remain after completion.
