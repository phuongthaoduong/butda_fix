# Phase 6 — UX Readability & Accessibility

## Goal
- Ensure CoT and answers are readable and stable across devices and window sizes.

## Scope (KISS)
- Typography and spacing tuned for clarity.
- Layout remains stable during streaming.

## Backend
- No changes.

## Frontend
- Adjust spacing, font sizes, and container widths.
- Keep CoT in a compact area; avoid layout shifts.
- CoT is presented in the frontend UI; readability and accessibility tweaks are frontend-only.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can read comfortably on laptop and mobile.
- Progress does not cause jitter or overlap.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Overcrowding on small screens: use compact style when needed.
