# Phase 5 — Copy & Flow Polish

## Goal
- Make CoT messages consistent, calm, and informative — without noise.

## Scope (KISS)
- Review wording across stages.
- Remove repetitions and jitter.

## Backend
- No changes.

## Frontend
- Normalize stage labels and deduplicate messages.
- Ensure natural progression: Starting → Searching → Reading → Thinking → Writing.
- CoT presentation stays in the frontend UI; polishing focuses on wording and flow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users feel informed with minimal reading.
- Messages are short, consistent, and non-repetitive.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Over-optimization: keep messages simple; avoid technical terms.
