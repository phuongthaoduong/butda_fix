# Phase 5 — User Testing

## How to Test
- Submit multiple queries in a row (short and long topics).
- Watch CoT messages across queries.

## What to Look For
- Consistent wording and order.
- No repeated “Loading” or noisy updates.
- You can skim and still understand what’s happening.

## Pass/Fail
- Pass: Messages are clean and consistent.
- Fail: Messages feel busy, inconsistent, or technical.
